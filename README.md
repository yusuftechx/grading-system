# Summary of Code Behavior:
* User Authentication: The code first checks if the user inputs the correct username and password combination. Only when the correct authentication  
  entered does it print "Login Successful." Incorrect credentials produce specific error
  messages for either an invalid password or an unknown username.

* Grade Classification: After authentication, the code evaluates a student's grade based on the numeric marks entered:

- 90 and above: Classified as "Excellent"
- 75 to 89: Classified as "First Class"
- 40 to 74: Classified as "Average"
- Below 40: Classified as "Fail"
